        <label for="q1">What exactly is financial coaching?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Financial coaching is ongoing, one‑to‑one support that helps you organise your money, reduce stress, and make confident day‑to‑day decisions. It combines education, structure, and accountability so you can build habits that actually last, instead of collecting tips you never implement.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q2">
        <label for="q2">How is this different from a financial advisor?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A financial advisor usually focuses on products and investments; a financial coach focuses on your behaviour, systems, and wellbeing. At Gold Pearl there is no product sales or complex jargon – just clear guidance so you can understand your own numbers and make independent choices.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q3">
        <label for="q3">Who is Gold Pearl for?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Gold Pearl is for individuals who are earning money but feel they “should be further ahead” or are tired of feeling guilty about spending. Many clients are professionals or young families who want more savings, less anxiety, and a financial plan that fits a real life, not a perfect spreadsheet.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q4">
        <label for="q4">What can we work on together?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a realistic monthly plan that you can actually follow</li>
            <li>Getting out of debt without extreme restriction</li>
            <li>Building an emergency buffer and long‑term savings</li>
            <li>Planning for big goals (moving, children, career changes, time off)</li>
            <li>Calming money anxiety and reducing guilt around spending</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every plan is tailored to your situation rather than squeezing you into a template programme.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q5">
        <label for="q5">What happens in a typical session?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Before your first session you fill in a short intake so there is a clear picture of your situation and goals. In each session you review what happened since last time, look at your numbers together, and agree on a small, specific set of actions for the next few weeks.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q6">
        <label for="q6">How long does coaching usually last?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Many clients work together for 3–6 months to build foundations, clear the main “fires”, and set up solid systems. Some choose to stay longer at a lower frequency for accountability, check‑ins, and support through big life changes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q7">
        <label for="q7">Is my information confidential and non‑judgmental?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. Your details are treated confidentially and are only used to support your coaching process, not for selling products or sharing with others. The space is deliberately non‑judgmental: the focus is on what you want to change now, not on shaming you for past decisions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q8">
        <label for="q8">How much does it cost, and how do payments work?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Gold Pearl offers clear, transparent pricing with no hidden add‑ons: you choose between a single “clarity session” and structured coaching packages, and you see the full cost in advance. Payment can be made in one go or in instalments, so support remains accessible while you improve your finances.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q9">
        <label for="q9">Is this worth it if I’m already worried about money?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>That concern is very common and completely understandable. The goal is that coaching helps you save more, waste less, and avoid expensive mistakes, so over time it becomes an investment in stability rather than “just another bill”.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q10">
        <label for="q10">Do you only work with people in the Netherlands?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Coaching is delivered online, so it is accessible from anywhere, but examples and references are grounded in everyday European life and prices. For regulated investment or tax issues, you are always referred back to licensed professionals in your own country when needed.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q11">
        <label for="q11">How do I get started?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>You begin with a 100% free, no‑strings‑attached consultation call, where you can share your situation and ask questions. After this, you receive a clear proposal outlining the recommended path, what is included, and the total investment, so you can decide calmly and without pressure.</p>
