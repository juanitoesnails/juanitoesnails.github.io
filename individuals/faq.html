        <label for="q1">What exactly is financial coaching?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Managing your finances can be complex and scary. Financial literacy is often neglected in education despite it having a major effect on our livelihood.</p>
            <p>Financial coaching combines education with practical guidance to help you organise your money, reduce stress and make confident day-to-day decisions. Unlike other professionals in finance, financial coaches approach money through an emotional, financial, and psychological lens. We take a deep dive into your current financial situation and give you the tools and steps to achieve your financial goals.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q2">
        <label for="q2">Do I need a financial coach or a financial advisor?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A financial advisor recommends individual financial products and manages their client's investments. This type of service is aimed at high-net-worth individuals with complex investment profiles. </p>
          <p>As financial coaches, we take a broader approach to your finances and work with you to improve your financial wellbeing. We look at your savings, spending, and budgets to give you the tools to make independent financial decisions that suit you and your goals. We don't recommend any particular stocks or investments, but we give you the knowledge to become an informed investor. </p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="q3">
        <label for="q3">Who is financial coaching best for?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Our services are designed for anyone who wants to improve their financial understanding, set meaningful financial goals, and build healthier money habits, regardless of background, income level, or current financial situation. Whether you feel like you've been doing everything “right” and still aren't getting ahead or opening your bank statement feels like too daunting of a task, we have a service for you.</p>

        <label for="q4">What can you achieve through financial coaching?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a realistic monthly plan that you can actually follow</li>
            <li>Getting out of debt without extreme restriction</li>
            <li>Building an emergency buffer and long‑term savings</li>
            <li>Planning for big goals (moving, children, career changes, time off)</li>
            <li>Calming money anxiety and reducing guilt around spending</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every plan is tailored to your situation rather than squeezing you into a template programme.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q5">
        <label for="q5">Where do you offer courses?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We aim to offer flexibility through our online courses and online personalised coaching which can be accessed from anywhere in the world. For in-person sessions, we currently operate within the Amsterdam region.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q6">
        <label for="q6">Is this about getting rich quickly?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p> No. We focus on sustainable financial wellbeing, not quick wins, risky tactics, or unrealistic promises.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q7">
        <label for="q7">Can a financial coach help me if I already make good money?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Once you have your spending and saving habits under control we can start focusing on big goals. We help clients get closer to retirement, plan for a family, and finance big purchases. </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q8">
        <label for="q8">Is financial coaching worth it if I’m already worried about money?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Our strategies are realistic for real people living real lives.</p>
          <p>Financial literacy is about making informed choices with what you have, not how much you earn. The goal is that coaching helps you save more, waste less, and avoid expensive mistakes, so over time it becomes an investment in stability rather than just another bill. </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q9">
        <label for="q9">Why does personal finance advice feel so overwhelming?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We know that financial concepts can often be overly complicated or difficult to understand. As professionals in finance we often see:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Financial professionals relying on complex terms and calculations</li>
          <li>Most adults never learn financial literacy during their education</li>
          <li>Advice found online that is outdated, unrealistic, or one-size-fits-all </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We demystify financial terms and break them down into simple ideas. We have a real-world approach that reflects today’s economic situation and your actual life.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q10">
        <label for="q10">How long does it take to see results?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Our clients report feeling more motivated about their financial situation after just 2 hours of coaching. Many tend to cut unnecessary expenses directly after their first session.</p>
          <p>For bigger goals, like getting out of debt or starting an emergency fund, we aim to have you see results after 6 months. This doesn't mean you need 6 months of sessions. Once you have the right tools, you can use them for life.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
        <input type="checkbox" id="q11">
        <label for="q11">Is my information confidential?</label>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We take your confidentiality seriously. We will never disclose your financial situation to anybody without your permission. For full information about our privacy policy, please see our privacy statement: <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Statement</a></p>
